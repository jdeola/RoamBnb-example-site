                        RoamBnB allows you to take a passive approach to owning rental properties while netting you two
                        to three times more money than traditional long term rentals. Our first step in the process involves
                        analyzing your property, or potential properties, to make sure itâ€™s a good fit as a short term rental. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Once we establish a property is a good fit, we handle 100% of the transition as well as the day to day
                        operations. Here at Roambnb we want you to take a permanent vacation from worrying about your
                        property and leave it to us!
